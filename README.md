## Introduction

This repository aims to provide beginner-friendly implementations of essential data structures in C. Each example includes detailed comments and explanations to help understand the concepts and code.

## Data Structures

### Self-Referential Structures

Self-referential structures are the foundation of many dynamic data structures. This section covers the basics of creating and using self-referential structures in C.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

Dynamic memory allocation is crucial for creating flexible and efficient data structures. This section demonstrates how to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically in C.

### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to the next. This section covers the creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal of a singly linked list.

### Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each element points to both the next and the previous elements. This section covers the creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal of a doubly linked list.

### Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a linear data structure where the last element points back to the first element, forming a circle. This section covers the creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal of a circular linked list.

### Basic Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This section covers the creation, push, pop, and peek operations of a stack.

### Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This section covers the creation, enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations of a queue.
